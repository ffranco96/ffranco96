🧑‍🎓 As a good student, im currently looking forward to improving my actual knowledge about programming and technologhy in general. I'm expecting to improve mi skills and learning new techonologies/programming languages, trying to understand their implementation on the actual market.
💻 My strong programming languages are C, C++ and Java. Some knowledge on HTML (frontend), VHDL (hardware description language), too.
🧔 📱 As I come from the branch of electronics, I'm interestested in the complement between software and hardware: application development for embedded systems, mobile development in Android.
🏦 🪙 Because of being currently working on payment methods, I have the business comprehension of the electronic payment methods such as Posnet, and POS terminals in general.
